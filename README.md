#Transcriptome and Proteome Dynamics of a Light-Dark Synchronized Bacterial Cell Cycle
<!--adbio-description-->
This data is taken from a publication by Jacob Waldbauer from the Chisholm group at MIT. (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0043432). The project was described as follows: Growth of the ocean's most abundant primary producer, the cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, is tightly synchronized to the natural 24-hour light-dark cycle. We sought to quantify the relationship between transcriptome and proteome dynamics that underlie this obligate photoautotroph's highly choreographed response to the daily oscillation in energy supply.
